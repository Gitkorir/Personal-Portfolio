        >I am a Biomedical Engineer and Software Engineering student with a deep
        passion for solving real-world problems through innovative technology.
        My academic journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in both the
        life sciences and computer science, allowing me to bridge the gap
        between engineering and healthcare. I am particularly interested in
        using technology to improve patient care, enhance medical devices, and
        develop software solutions that make a positive impact on people's
        lives. With a strong problem-solving mindset, I strive to create
        efficient, scalable, and user-friendly solutions that address complex
        challenges in the biomedical and software engineering fields.</i
